When sending eth or money or transaction on the blockchain, their is always a 'value' field that gets populated and is always populated in the transaction data and most of the time it gets sent with zero. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16b33760-8b46-4e30-84ad-8a2cb02c52ea)
Even in our Metamask, when sending transactions between two accounts that we own, the amount field populates the value field in our transaction.
The 'value' is the amount of native cryptocurrency (Wei) that gets sent with every transaction.
